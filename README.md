## Mostafa Yasser Mansour (solve)

Hello There,
This is a solution of a task provided by `intern2grow`.

I added a new column for "quantity", where user can increase and decrease the quantity of product using + and - buttons.

And a new column for "Full Price" where user see the full price of the product that its quantity is more than one (full price = item quantity X item price).

A the "Total price" is now the total full "price of" the product that's.
